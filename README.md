# Mini-sites

Small projects I've created that aren't big enough for their own repo, but I still want to share.

## Snake

The classic phone game! Manuever a snake to eat food, and grow bigger as you eat. Hit the sides or your body and the game is over!

I decided to create a version of this after working through the Etch a Sketch exercise in Wes Bos' Beginner JavaScript course. It was so much fun working with canvas on that, I needed to try it out on my own!

There were definitely some struggles, and this isn't exactly the same as the original version, but it's fairly close and I'm quite happy with it!
